Installation
-----------------------------

To install this application you will need a text editor like Visual Studio Code. There are several NPM packages which you should be able to install with "npm install" in your CLI. You will also need to install the Tailwindcss framework (https://tailwindcss.com/), PUG HTML compiler (https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html), and Sass CSS compiler (https://sass-lang.com/).


Features
-----------------------------
This site was developed with Tailwindcss, Pug and Sass. It incorporates a grid system to create a responsive layout. Items that would normally display in multiple columns should display as a single column on smaller screens.
